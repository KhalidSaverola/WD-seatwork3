### Overview
<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
Description of the project in details.

What is the project?
The project is a website developed using HTML and CSS. It includes multiple pages with a consistent header and footer design across all pages. Each page features distinct designs and animations to enhance user engagement and visual appeal.

Purpose:
The primary purpose of the project is to showcase proficiency in HTML and CSS while demonstrating creativity in design and animation. It aims to provide a practical application of front-end web development skills by creating a cohesive and visually appealing website structure.

Key Components:

Header and Footer: Consistent elements across all pages, providing navigation and essential information.
Multiple Pages: Each page presents a different design theme or concept.
Design Variations: Five distinct design layouts are implemented, showcasing different aesthetic choices and user experiences.
Animations: Each page incorporates animations using CSS, enhancing user interaction and visual interest.
Responsive Design: Ensures the website adapts well to different screen sizes and devices, enhancing accessibility.

Technology Used and How It Is Used:
HTML: Used for structuring the content of each webpage, defining elements such as headers, paragraphs, and links.
CSS: Utilized for styling the HTML elements, including layout design, colors, typography, and animations.
Animation with CSS: CSS animations are employed to create visual effects like transitions, transformations, and keyframe animations. This adds dynamism and interactivity to the website without relying on external libraries or JavaScript.
Responsive Design: CSS media queries are implemented to ensure the website displays correctly on various devices, such as desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
Implementation Details:

Header and Footer: These are implemented as separate HTML files (e.g., header.html, footer.html) and included in each webpage using server-side includes or JavaScript includes for ease of maintenance and consistency.
Design Variations: Different CSS stylesheets are used to apply distinct visual themes to each page. This includes variations in color schemes, typography, layout structures, and image treatments.
Animations: CSS animations are defined in the CSS files using @keyframes and applied selectively to elements on the webpage (e.g., fade-ins, sliding effects, hover animations).
Responsive Design: Media queries ensure that the website layout adjusts fluidly to different viewport sizes, optimizing user experience across devices.

Overall, the project exemplifies competence in HTML and CSS by creating a multi-page website with a cohesive header-footer structure, diverse design choices, and engaging animations. It demonstrates practical skills in web development and showcases creativity in user interface design and front-end implementation.
